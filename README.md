# FriendlyReviews
Our Final project for the first degree.

Friendly Reviews is a Single page Web app we created to help people share to what places they ought to go out to or not.
We developed a very user friendly UI and blazingly fast server for the best experience possible.

The client was written in HTML5/JS/CSS3 using the JQuery and Bootstrap frameworks.
The server was written in JS using Node.js and MongoDB.
